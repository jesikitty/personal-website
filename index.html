				<span>A bit about me</span>
				<p>
					Hello there! I'm Jesi Merrick (aka jesikitty). I'm a software developer, with a current focus on full-stack JavaScript web development. I graduated from Illinois Tech with my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science back in 2015, and since then I've had the chance to work in a few different technologies and environments (starting with some PHP, then later NodeJS and MeteorJS).
				</p>
				<p>
					The learning continues however! Lately I've been learning about RxJS, React, functional programming, and just overall improving my skill and knowledge when it comes to web development.

				<span>My career</span>
				<p>
					Straight out of college, I started my first full-time developer position over at <a href="http://www.wellspring.com/">Wellspring Worldwide</a>. For a short time after that, I helped a small startup get ready for its first launch, where I got to jump back into MeteorJS. It was an interesting project to work on, and I hope to see them go far. Now days, I'm over at <a href="http://www.digitalprimates.net/">Digital Primates</a> where I am continuing to learn and grow as a software developer!
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of development work, I've also discovered an interest in teaching. The summer before my third year at Illinois Tech, I was an assistant for a summer camp that introduces middle school girls to Computer Science. This launched off a love for teaching that I did not expect! Since then, I have helped with the same camp for two other summers, as well as the Fall and Spring clubs that we run for advanced students. Whether with the <a href="http://cs.iit.edu/~stars/">STARS</a> program at IIT (oh, hey, I helped put together their website as well!), or elsewhere, I hope to continue teaching in the future.

				<span>In my spare time</span>
				<p>
					I have a few different hobbies I explore in my spare time. I've been attending local Chicago gaming/sci-fi/anime/furry conventions for several years now, and am big into both table-top gaming and cosplaying (my current favorite cosplays are Stocking, from Panty and Stocking, and Ryuko, from Kill La Kill).
				</p>
				<p>
					I am also an avid reader, and like to get out for hiking and traveling. My family is rather spread out, so I spend time in Antigua, Guatemala and Toronto, Canada when I can!
